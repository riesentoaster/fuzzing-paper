  abstract  = {We present a new tool, named DART, for automatically testing software that combines three main techniques: (1) automated extraction of the interface of a program with its external environment using static source-code parsing; (2) automatic generation of a test driver for this interface that performs random testing to simulate the most general environment the program can operate in; and (3) dynamic analysis of how the program behaves under random testing and automatic generation of new test inputs to direct systematically the execution along alternative program paths. Together, these three techniques constitute Directed Automated Random Testing, or DART for short. The main strength of DART is thus that testing can be performed completely automatically on any program that compiles -- there is no need to write any test driver or harness code. During testing, DART detects standard errors such as program crashes, assertion violations, and non-termination. Preliminary experiments to unit test several examples of C programs are very encouraging.},

  abstract  = {Whitebox fuzzing is a form of automatic dynamic test generation, based on symbolic execution and constraint solving, designed for security testing of large applications. Unfortunately, the current effectiveness of whitebox fuzzing is limited when testing applications with highly-structured inputs, such as compilers and interpreters. These applications process their inputs in stages, such as lexing, parsing and evaluation. Due to the enormous number of control paths in early processing stages, whitebox fuzzing rarely reaches parts of the application beyond those first stages.In this paper, we study how to enhance whitebox fuzzing of complex structured-input applications with a grammar-based specification of their valid inputs. We present a novel dynamic test generation algorithm where symbolic execution directly generates grammar-based constraints whose satisfiability is checked using a custom grammar-based constraint solver. We have implemented this algorithm and evaluated it on a large security-critical application, the JavaScript interpreter of Internet Explorer 7 (IE7). Results of our experiments show that grammar-based whitebox fuzzing explores deeper program paths and avoids dead-ends due to non-parsable inputs. Compared to regular whitebox fuzzing, grammar-based whitebox fuzzing increased coverage of the code generation module of the IE7 JavaScript interpreter from 53\% to 81\% while using three times fewer tests.},

KLEE-generated tests achieve high line coverage -- on average over 90\% per tool (median: over 94\%) -- and significantly beat the coverage of the developers' own hand-written test suite. When we did the same for 75 equivalent tools in the BUSYBOX embedded system suite, results were even better, including 100\% coverage on 31 of them.We also used KLEE as a bug finding tool, applying it to 452 applications (over 430K total lines of code), where it found 56 serious bugs, including three in COREUTILS that had been missed for over 15 years. Finally, we used KLEE to crosscheck purportedly identical BUSYBOX and COREUTILS utilities, finding functional correctness errors and a myriad of inconsistencies.},

It inputs irregular test data into a target program to try to trigger a vulnerable condition in the program execution. Since the first random fuzzing system was constructed, fuzzing efficiency has been greatly improved by combination with several useful techniques, including dynamic symbolic execution, coverage guide, grammar representation, scheduling algorithms, dynamic taint analysis, static analysis and machine learning. In this paper, we will systematically review these techniques and their corresponding representative fuzzing systems. By introducing the principles, advantages and disadvantages of these techniques, we hope to provide researchers with a systematic and deeper understanding of fuzzing techniques and provide some references for this field.}

In this paper, we introduce Directed Greybox Fuzzing (DGF) which generates inputs with the objective of reaching a given set of target program locations efficiently. We develop and evaluate a simulated annealing-based power schedule that gradually assigns more energy to seeds that are closer to the target locations while reducing energy for seeds that are further away. Experiments with our implementation AFLGo demonstrate that DGF outperforms both directed symbolic-execution-based whitebox fuzzing and undirected greybox fuzzing. We show applications of DGF to patch testing and crash reproduction, and discuss the integration of AFLGo into Google's continuous fuzzing platform OSS-Fuzz. Due to its directedness, AFLGo could find 39 bugs in several well-fuzzed, security-critical projects like LibXML2. 17 CVEs were assigned.},

  abstract  = {Fuzzing and symbolic execution are popular techniques for finding vulnerabilities and generating test-cases for programs. Fuzzing, a blackbox method that mutates seed input values, is generally incapable of generating diverse inputs that exercise all paths in the program. Due to the path-explosion problem and dependence on SMT solvers, symbolic execution may also not achieve high path coverage. A hybrid technique involving fuzzing and symbolic execution may achieve better function coverage than fuzzing or symbolic execution alone. In this paper, we present Munch, an open-source framework implementing two hybrid techniques based on fuzzing and symbolic execution. We empirically show using nine large open-source programs that overall, Munch achieves higher (in-depth) function coverage than symbolic execution or fuzzing alone. Using metrics based on total analyses time and number of queries issued to the SMT solver, we also show that Munch is more efficient at achieving better function coverage.},

  abstract   = {High scalability and low running costs have made fuzz testing the de facto standard for discovering software bugs. Fuzzing techniques are constantly being improved in a race to build the ultimate bug-finding tool. However, while fuzzing excels at finding bugs in the wild, evaluating and comparing fuzzer performance is challenging due to the lack of metrics and benchmarks. For example, crash count---perhaps the most commonly-used performance metric---is inaccurate due to imperfections in deduplication techniques. Additionally, the lack of a unified set of targets results in ad hoc evaluations that hinder fair comparison. We tackle these problems by developing Magma, a ground-truth fuzzing benchmark that enables uniform fuzzer evaluation and comparison. By introducing real bugs into real software, Magma allows for the realistic evaluation of fuzzers against a broad set of targets. By instrumenting these bugs, Magma also enables the collection of bug-centric performance metrics independent of the fuzzer. Magma is an open benchmark consisting of seven targets that perform a variety of input manipulations and complex computations, presenting a challenge to state-of-the-art fuzzers. We evaluate seven widely-used mutation-based fuzzers (AFL, AFLFast, AFL++, FairFuzz, MOpt-AFL, honggfuzz, and SymCC-AFL) against Magma over 200,000 CPU-hours. Based on the number of bugs reached, triggered, and detected, we draw conclusions about the fuzzers' exploration and detection capabilities. This provides insight into fuzzer performance evaluation, highlighting the importance of ground truth in performing more accurate and meaningful evaluations.},

  abstract   = {Fuzz testing (fuzzing) has witnessed its prosperity in detecting security flaws recently. It generates a large number of test cases and monitors the executions for defects. Fuzzing has detected thousands of bugs and vulnerabilities in various applications. Although effective, there lacks systematic analysis of gaps faced by fuzzing. As a technique of defect detection, fuzzing is required to narrow down the gaps between the entire input space and the defect space. Without limitation on the generated inputs, the input space is infinite. However, defects are sparse in an application, which indicates that the defect space is much smaller than the entire input space. Besides, because fuzzing generates numerous test cases to repeatedly examine targets, it requires fuzzing to perform in an automatic manner. Due to the complexity of applications and defects, it is challenging to automatize the execution of diverse applications. In this article, we systematically review and analyze the gaps as well as their solutions, considering both breadth and depth. This survey can be a roadmap for both beginners and advanced developers to better understand fuzzing.},

Each technique is wrapped beneath the black-, white-, and grey-box fuzzers to uncover diverse vulnerabilities. It consists of methods such as identifying structural information about the test cases to detect security vulnerabilities, symbolic and concrete program states to explore the unexplored locations, and full semantics of code coverage to create new test cases. We methodically examine each kind of fuzzers and contemporary fuzzers with a profound observation that addresses various research questions and systematically reviews and analyze the gaps and their solutions.

The approach used builds on previous work combining symbolic and concrete execution, and more specifically, using such a combination to generate test inputs to explore all feasible execution paths. The current work develops a method to represent and track constraints that capture the behavior of a symbolic execution of a unit with memory graphs as inputs. Moreover, an efficient constraint solver is proposed to facilitate incremental generation of such test inputs.

  abstract  = {Dowser is a 'guided' fuzzer that combines taint tracking, program analysis and symbolic execution to find buffer overflow and underflow vulnerabilities buried deep in a program's logic. The key idea is that analysis of a program lets us pinpoint the right areas in the program code to probe and the appropriate inputs to do so.Intuitively, for typical buffer overflows, we need consider only the code that accesses an array in a loop, rather than all possible instructions in the program. After finding all such candidate sets of instructions, we rank them according to an estimation of how likely they are to contain interesting vulnerabilities. We then subject the most promising sets to further testing. Specifically, we first use taint analysis to determine which input bytes influence the array index and then execute the program symbolically, making only this set of inputs symbolic. By constantly steering the symbolic execution along branch outcomes most likely to lead to overflows, we were able to detect deep bugs in real programs (like the nginx webserver, the inspircd IRC server, and the ffmpeg videoplayer). Two of the bugs we found were previously undocumented buffer overflows in ffmpeg and the poppler PDF rendering library.},

  abstract  = {Automated program testing tools typically try to explore, and cover, as much of a tested program as possible, while attempting to trigger and detect bugs. An alternative and complementary approach can be to first select a specific part of a program that may be subject to a specific class of bug, and then narrowly focus exploration towards program paths that could trigger such a bug.In this work, we introduce the BORG (Buffer Over-Read Guard), a testing tool that uses static and dynamic program analysis, taint propagation and symbolic execution to detect buffer overread bugs in real-world programs. BORG works by first selecting buffer accesses that could lead to an overread and then guiding symbolic execution towards those accesses along program paths that could actually lead to an overread. BORG operates on binaries and does not require source code. To demonstrate BORG's effectiveness, we use it to detect overreads in six complex server applications and libraries, including lighttpd, FFmpeg and ClamAV.},

  abstract  = {Many real-world programs take highly structured and very complex inputs. The automated testing of such programs is non-trivial. If the test input does not adhere to a specific file format, the program returns a parser error. For symbolic execution-based whitebox fuzzing the corresponding error handling code becomes a significant time sink. Too much time is spent in the parser exploring too many paths leading to trivial parser errors. Naturally, the time is better spent exploring the functional part of the program where failure with valid input exposes deep and real bugs in the program. In this paper, we suggest to leverage information about the file format and the data chunks of existing, valid files to swiftly carry the exploration beyond the parser code. We call our approach Model-based Whitebox Fuzzing (MoWF) because the file format input model of blackbox fuzzers can be exploited as a constraint on the vast input space to rule out most invalid inputs during path exploration in symbolic execution. We evaluate on 13 vulnerabilities in 8 large program binaries with 6 separate file formats and found that MoWF exposes all vulnerabilities while both, traditional whitebox fuzzing and model-based blackbox fuzzing, expose only less than half, respectively. Our experiments also demonstrate that MoWF exposes 70\% vulnerabilities without any seed inputs.},

  abstract   = {This paper presents S2E, a platform for analyzing the properties and behavior of software systems. We demonstrate S2E's use in developing practical tools for comprehensive performance profiling, reverse engineering of proprietary software, and bug finding for both kernel-mode and user-mode binaries. Building these tools on top of S2E took less than 770 LOC and 40 person-hours each.S2E's novelty consists of its ability to scale to large real systems, such as a full Windows stack. S2E is based on two new ideas: selective symbolic execution, a way to automatically minimize the amount of code that has to be executed symbolically given a target analysis, and relaxed execution consistency models, a way to make principled performance/accuracy trade-offs in complex analyses. These techniques give S2E three key abilities: to simultaneously analyze entire families of execution paths, instead of just one execution at a time; to perform the analyses in-vivo within a real software stack--user programs, libraries, kernel, drivers, etc.--instead of using abstract models of these layers; and to operate directly on binaries, thus being able to analyze even proprietary software.Conceptually, S2E is an automated path explorer with modular path analyzers: the explorer drives the target system down all execution paths of interest, while analyzers check properties of each such path (e.g., to look for bugs) or simply collect information (e.g., count page faults). Desired paths can be specified in multiple ways, and S2E users can either combine existing analyzers to build a custom analysis tool, or write new analyzers using the S2E API.},

Recently, researchers have devoted significant effort to devising new fuzzing techniques, strategies, and algorithms. Such new ideas are primarily evaluated experimentally so an important question is: What experimental setup is needed to produce trustworthy results? We surveyed the recent research literature and assessed the experimental evaluations carried out by 32 fuzzing papers. We found problems in every evaluation we considered. We then performed our own extensive experimental evaluation using an existing fuzzer. Our results showed that the general problems we found in existing experimental evaluations can indeed translate to actual wrong or misleading assessments. We conclude with some guidelines that we hope will help improve experimental evaluations of fuzz testing algorithms, making reported results more robust.},

To achieve a maximum benefit-to-cost ratio and without complication, we use fuzz testing [11]. In addition, during the development and debugging of a system, we may fail to notice the kinds of shortcoming that fuzz testing can expose. Fuzz testing types are different depending on the target they fuzz. Application, file format, and protocol fuzzing are the most common fuzzing types. A protocol fuzzer sends counterfeit packets to a target system while changing the normal packet en-route and sometimes replaying them. In addition, a protocol fuzzer sometimes acts as proxy server for clients. This survey study examines network protocol fuzz testing. We identified several studies on network protocol fuzzing. Most focus on application layers of the Open Systems Interconnection model. We primarily review the approaches of five studies and the targets and protocol layers they fuzz. We then develop criteria to compare these approaches in detail.},

  abstract  = {Background: Firmware is the enable software of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and its software vulnerabilities are one of the primary reason of IoT devices being exploited. Due to the limited resources of IoT devices, it is impractical to deploy sophisticated run-time protection techniques. Under an insecure network environment, when a firmware is exploited, it may lead to denial of service, information disclosure, elevation of privilege, or even life-threatening. Therefore, firmware vulnerability detection by fuzzing has become the key to ensure the security of IoT devices, and has also become a hot topic in academic and industrial research. With the rapid growth of the existing IoT devices, the size and complexity of firmware, the variety of firmware types, and the firmware defects, existing IoT firmware fuzzing methods face challenges. Objective: This paper summarizes the typical types of IoT firmware fuzzing methods, analyzes the contribution of these works, and summarizes the shortcomings of existing fuzzing methods. Method: We design several research questions, extract keywords from the research questions, then use the keywords to search for related literature. Result: We divide the existing firmware fuzzing work into real-device-based fuzzing and simulation-based fuzzing according to the firmware execution environment, and simulation-based fuzzing is the mainstream in the future; we found that the main types of vulnerabilities targeted by existing fuzzing methods are memory corruption vulnerabilities; firmware fuzzing faces more difficulties than ordinary software fuzzing. Conclusion: Through the analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of different methods, this review provides guidance for further improving the performance of fuzzing techniques, and proposes several recommendations from the findings of this review.},

  abstract = {One of the major concerns of dynamic symbolic execution (DSE) based automated test case generation is its huge search space which restricts its usage for industrial-size program testing. In fact, DSE performs test case generation by exploring paths of the program, and the number of program paths is exponential in the number of branch conditions encountered during execution. Thus, by increasing the number of branches, the search space will be extremely large and without applying an effective and efficient technique to explore the search space, DSE would fail to achieve the predesignated goals in the given budget. To this end, different search strategies have been proposed to prioritize program paths and to select the most promising ones with respect to the testing goal. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive systematic review of search strategies in DSE. We collect different techniques and methods concerning the topic, classify and summarize them, highlight their advantages and drawbacks, and provide a complete comparison of the methods in each category. The classification is carried out according to the type of search and also the information source exploited by the strategies to direct DSE. We also analyze the evaluation methodologies of experiments reported on this subject, give a general overview of them, perform a set of experiments and provide a set of guidelines for conducting future experiments in this area of research.}

  abstract   = {This article presents EXE, an effective bug-finding tool that automatically generates inputs that crash real code. Instead of running code on manually or randomly constructed input, EXE runs it on symbolic input initially allowed to be anything. As checked code runs, EXE tracks the constraints on each symbolic (i.e., input-derived) memory location. If a statement uses a symbolic value, EXE does not run it, but instead adds it as an input-constraint; all other statements run as usual. If code conditionally checks a symbolic expression, EXE forks execution, constraining the expression to be true on the true branch and false on the other. Because EXE reasons about all possible values on a path, it has much more power than a traditional runtime tool: (1) it can force execution down any feasible program path and (2) at dangerous operations (e.g., a pointer dereference), it detects if the current path constraints allow any value that causes a bug. When a path terminates or hits a bug, EXE automatically generates a test case by solving the current path constraints to find concrete values using its own co-designed constraint solver, STP. Because EXE’s constraints have no approximations, feeding this concrete input to an uninstrumented version of the checked code will cause it to follow the same path and hit the same bug (assuming deterministic code).EXE works well on real code, finding bugs along with inputs that trigger them in: the BSD and Linux packet filter implementations, the dhcpd DHCP server, the pcre regular expression library, and three Linux file systems.},

  abstract  = {Recent work has used variations of symbolic execution to automatically generate high-coverage test inputs [3, 4, 7, 8, 14]. Such tools have demonstrated their ability to find very subtle errors. However, one challenge they all face is how to effectively handle the exponential number of paths in checked code. This paper presents a new technique for reducing the number of traversed code paths by discarding those that must have side-effects identical to some previously explored path. Our results on a mix of open source applications and device drivers show that this (sound) optimization reduces the numbers of paths traversed by several orders of magnitude, often achieving program coverage far out of reach for a standard constraint-based execution system.},

  abstract  = {Typical security contests focus on breaking or mitigating the impact of buggy systems. We present the Build-it, Break-it, Fix-it (BIBIFI) contest, which aims to assess the ability to securely build software, not just break it. In BIBIFI, teams build specified software with the goal of maximizing correctness, performance, and security. The latter is tested when teams attempt to break other teams' submissions. Winners are chosen from among the best builders and the best breakers. BIBIFI was designed to be open-ended-teams can use any language, tool, process, etc. that they like. As such, contest outcomes shed light on factors that correlate with successfully building secure software and breaking insecure software. During 2015, we ran three contests involving a total of 116 teams and two different programming problems. Quantitative analysis from these contests found that the most efficient build-it submissions used C/C++, but submissions coded in other statically-typed languages were less likely to have a security flaw; build-it teams with diverse programming-language knowledge also produced more secure code. Shorter programs correlated with better scores. Break-it teams that were also successful build-it teams were significantly better at finding security bugs.},

  abstract   = {Property-based random testing, exemplified by frameworks such as Haskell's QuickCheck, works by testing an executable predicate (a property) on a stream of randomly generated inputs. Property testing works very well in many cases, but not always. Some properties are conditioned on the input satisfying demanding semantic invariants that are not consequences of its syntactic structure---e.g., that an input list must be sorted or have no duplicates. Most randomly generated inputs fail to satisfy properties with such sparse preconditions, and so are simply discarded. As a result, much of the target system may go untested. We address this issue with a novel technique called coverage guided, property based testing (CGPT). Our approach is inspired by the related area of coverage guided fuzzing, exemplified by tools like AFL. Rather than just generating a fresh random input at each iteration, CGPT can also produce new inputs by mutating previous ones using type-aware, generic mutator operators. The target program is instrumented to track which control flow branches are executed during a run and inputs whose runs expand control-flow coverage are retained for future mutations. This means that, when sparse conditions in the target are satisfied and new coverage is observed, the input that triggered them will be retained and used as a springboard to go further. We have implemented CGPT as an extension to the QuickChick property testing tool for Coq programs; we call our implementation FuzzChick. We evaluate FuzzChick on two Coq developments for abstract machines that aim to enforce flavors of noninterference, which has a (very) sparse precondition. We systematically inject bugs in the machines' checking rules and use FuzzChick to look for counterexamples to the claim that they satisfy a standard noninterference property. We find that vanilla QuickChick almost always fails to find any bugs after a long period of time, as does an earlier proposal for combining property testing and fuzzing. In contrast, FuzzChick often finds them within seconds to minutes. Moreover, FuzzChick is almost fully automatic; although highly tuned, hand-written generators can find the bugs faster, they require substantial amounts of insight and manual effort.},

Unfortunately, many of these changes bring unexpected bugs that break the stability of the system or affect its security. In this paper, we address this problem using a technique for automatically testing code patches. Our technique combines symbolic execution with several novel heuristics based on static and dynamic program analysis which allow it to quickly reach the code of the patch. We have implemented our approach in a tool called KATCH, which we have applied to all the patches written in a combined period of approximately six years for nineteen mature programs from the popular GNU diffutils, GNU binutils and GNU findutils utility suites, which are shipped with virtually all UNIX-based distributions. Our results show that KATCH can automatically synthesise inputs that significantly increase the patch coverage achieved by the existing manual test suites, and find bugs at the moment they are introduced.},

As a result, our technique works by lowering the Intel Streaming SIMD Extension (SSE) instruction set to primitive integer and floating-point operations, and then using an algorithm based on symbolic expression matching augmented with canonicalization rules.Under symbolic execution, we have to verify equivalence along every feasible control-flow path. We reduce the branching factor of this process by aggressively merging conditionals, if-converting branches into select operations via an aggressive phi-node folding transformation.We applied KLEE-FP to OpenCV, a popular open source computer vision library. KLEE-FP was able to successfully crosscheck 51 SIMD/SSE implementations against their corresponding scalar versions, proving the bounded equivalence of 41 of them (i.e., on images up to a certain size), and finding inconsistencies in the other 10.},

In this paper, we present Covrig, a flexible infrastructure that can be used to run each version of a system in isolation and collect static and dynamic software metrics, using a lightweight virtual machine environment that can be deployed on a cluster of local or cloud machines. We use Covrig to conduct an empirical study examining how code and tests co-evolve in six popular open-source systems. We report the main characteristics of software patches, analyse the evolution of program and patch coverage, assess the impact of nondeterminism on the execution of test suites, and investigate whether the coverage of code containing bugs and bug fixes is higher than average.},

  abstract  = {We investigate the use of coverage-guided fuzzing as a means of proving satisfiability of SMT formulas over finite variable domains, with specific application to floating-point constraints. We show how an SMT formula can be encoded as a program containing a location that is reachable if and only if the program’s input corresponds to a satisfying assignment to the formula. A coverage-guided fuzzer can then be used to search for an input that reaches the location, yielding a satisfying assignment. We have implemented this idea in a tool, Just Fuzz-it Solver (JFS), and we present a large experimental evaluation showing that JFS is both competitive with and complementary to state-of-the-art SMT solvers with respect to solving floating-point constraints, and that the coverage-guided approach of JFS provides significant benefit over naive fuzzing in the floating-point domain. Applied in a portfolio manner, the JFS approach thus has the potential to complement traditional SMT solvers for program analysis tasks that involve reasoning about floating-point constraints.},

  abstract  = {Programs expecting structured inputs often consist of both a syntactic analysis stage, which parses raw input, and a semantic analysis stage, which conducts checks on the parsed input and executes the core logic of the program. Generator-based testing tools in the lineage of QuickCheck are a promising way to generate random syntactically valid test inputs for these programs. We present Zest, a technique which automatically guides QuickCheck-like random input generators to better explore the semantic analysis stage of test programs. Zest converts random-input generators into deterministic parametric input generators. We present the key insight that mutations in the untyped parameter domain map to structural mutations in the input domain. Zest leverages program feedback in the form of code coverage and input validity to perform feedback-directed parameter search. We evaluate Zest against AFL and QuickCheck on five Java programs: Maven, Ant, BCEL, Closure, and Rhino. Zest covers 1.03x-2.81x as many branches within the benchmarks' semantic analysis stages as baseline techniques. Further, we find 10 new bugs in the semantic analysis stages of these benchmarks. Zest is the most effective technique in finding these bugs reliably and quickly, requiring at most 10 minutes on average to find each bug.},

  abstract   = {Coverage-guided fuzz testing has gained prominence as a highly effective method of finding security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows in programs that parse binary data. Recently, researchers have introduced various specializations to the coverage-guided fuzzing algorithm for different domain-specific testing goals, such as finding performance bottlenecks, generating valid inputs, handling magic-byte comparisons, etc. Each such solution can require non-trivial implementation effort and produces a distinct variant of a fuzzing tool. We observe that many of these domain-specific solutions follow a common solution pattern. In this paper, we present FuzzFactory, a framework for developing domain-specific fuzzing applications without requiring changes to mutation and search heuristics. FuzzFactory allows users to specify the collection of dynamic domain-specific feedback during test execution, as well as how such feedback should be aggregated. FuzzFactory uses this information to selectively save intermediate inputs, called waypoints, to augment coverage-guided fuzzing. Such waypoints always make progress towards domain-specific multi-dimensional objectives. We instantiate six domain-specific fuzzing applications using FuzzFactory: three re-implementations of prior work and three novel solutions, and evaluate their effectiveness on benchmarks from Google's fuzzer test suite. We also show how multiple domains can be composed to perform better than the sum of their parts. For example, we combine domain-specific feedback about strict equality comparisons and dynamic memory allocations, to enable the automatic generation of LZ4 bombs and PNG bombs.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, fuzz testing has proven itself to be one of the most effective techniques for finding correctness bugs and security vulnerabilities in practice. One particular fuzz testing tool, American Fuzzy Lop (AFL), has become popular thanks to its ease-of-use and bug-finding power. However, AFL remains limited in the bugs it can find since it simply does not cover large regions of code. If it does not cover parts of the code, it will not find bugs there. We propose a two-pronged approach to increase the coverage achieved by AFL. First, the approach automatically identifies branches exercised by few AFL-produced inputs (rare branches), which often guard code that is empirically hard to cover by naively mutating inputs. The second part of the approach is a novel mutation mask creation algorithm, which allows mutations to be biased towards producing inputs hitting a given rare branch. This mask is dynamically computed during fuzz testing and can be adapted to other testing targets. We implement this approach on top of AFL in a tool named FairFuzz. We conduct evaluation on real-world programs against state-of-the-art versions of AFL. We find that on these programs FairFuzz achieves high branch coverage at a faster rate that state-of-the-art versions of AFL. In addition, on programs with nested conditional structure, it achieves sustained increases in branch coverage after 24 hours (average 10.6\% increase). In qualitative analysis, we find that FairFuzz has an increased capacity to automatically discover keywords.},

JQF is designed both for practitioners, who wish to find bugs in Java programs, as well as for researchers, who wish to implement new fuzzing algorithms.

JQF instruments the test program's bytecode and continuously executes tests using inputs that are generated in a coverage-guided fuzzing loop. JQF's input-generation mechanism is extensible. Researchers can implement custom fuzzing algorithms by extending JQF's Guidance interface. A Guidance instance responds to code coverage events generated during the execution of a test case, such as function calls and conditional jumps, and provides the next input. We describe several guidances that currently ship with JQF, such as: semantic fuzzing with Zest, binary fuzzing with AFL, and complexity fuzzing with PerfFuzz. JQF is a mature tool that is open-source and publicly available. At the time of writing, JQF has been successful in discovering 42 previously unknown bugs in widely used open-source software such as OpenJDK, Apache Commons, and the Google Closure Compiler.},

  abstract  = {Performance problems in software can arise unexpectedly when programs are provided with inputs that exhibit worst-case behavior. A large body of work has focused on diagnosing such problems via statistical profiling techniques. But how does one find these inputs in the first place? We present PerfFuzz, a method to automatically generate inputs that exercise pathological behavior across program locations, without any domain knowledge. PerfFuzz generates inputs via feedback-directed mutational fuzzing. Unlike previous approaches that attempt to maximize only a scalar characteristic such as the total execution path length, PerfFuzz uses multi-dimensional feedback and independently maximizes execution counts for all program locations. This enables PerfFuzz to (1) find a variety of inputs that exercise distinct hot spots in a program and (2) generate inputs with higher total execution path length than previous approaches by escaping local maxima. PerfFuzz is also effective at generating inputs that demonstrate algorithmic complexity vulnerabilities. We implement PerfFuzz on top of AFL, a popular coverage-guided fuzzing tool, and evaluate PerfFuzz on four real-world C programs typically used in the fuzzing literature.

  abstract  = {Property-based testing is a popular approach for validating the logic of a program. An effective property-based test quickly generates many diverse valid test inputs and runs them through a parameterized test driver. However, when the test driver requires strict validity constraints on the inputs, completely random input generation fails to generate enough valid inputs. Existing approaches to solving this problem rely on whitebox or greybox information collected by instrumenting the input generator and/or test driver. However, collecting such information reduces the speed at which tests can be executed. In this paper, we propose and study a black-box approach for generating valid test inputs. We first formalize the problem of guiding random input generators towards producing a diverse set of valid inputs. This formalization highlights the role of a guide which governs the space of choices within a random input generator. We then propose a solution based on reinforcement learning (RL), using a tabular, on-policy RL approach to guide the generator. We evaluate this approach, RLCheck, against pure random input generation as well as a state-of-the-art greybox evolutionary algorithm, on four real-world benchmarks. We find that in the same time budget, RLCheck generates an order of magnitude more diverse valid inputs than the baselines.},

Meanwhile, the market of embedded systems, which binds the software execution tightly to the very hardware architecture, has grown at a steady pace, and that pace is anticipated to become yet more sustained in the near future. Embedded systems also benefit from fuzzing, but the innumerable existing architectures and hardware peripherals complicate the development of general and usable approaches, hence a plethora of tools have recently appeared. Here comes a stringent need for a systematic review in the area of fuzzing approaches for embedded systems, which we term ``embedded fuzzing'' for brevity. The inclusion criteria chosen in this article are semi-objective in their coverage of the most relevant publication venues as well as of our personal judgement. The review rests on a formal definition we develop to represent the realm of embedded fuzzing. It continues by discussing the approaches that satisfy the inclusion criteria, then defines the relevant elements of comparison and groups the approaches according to how the execution environment is served to the system under test. The resulting review produces a table with 42 entries, which in turn supports discussion suggesting vast room for future research due to the limitations noted.},

  abstract       = {Network protocols, as the communication rules among computer network devices, are the foundation for the normal operation of networks. However, security issues arising from design flaws and implementation vulnerabilities in network protocols pose significant risks to network operations and security. Network protocol fuzzing is an effective technique for discovering and mitigating security flaws in network protocols. It offers unparalleled advantages compared to other security analysis techniques thanks to the minimal requirement for prior knowledge of the target and low deployment complexity. Nevertheless, the randomness in test case generation, uncontrollable test coverage, and unstable testing efficiency introduce challenges in ensuring the controllability of the testing process and results. In order to comprehensively survey the development of network protocol fuzzing techniques and analyze their advantages and existing issues, in this paper, we categorized and summarized the protocol fuzzing and its related techniques based on the generation methods of test cases and testing conditions. Specifically, we overviewed the development trajectory and patterns of these techniques over the past two decades according to chronological order. Based on this analysis, we further predict the future directions of fuzzing techniques.},

  abstract  = {Fuzz testing is an effective and scalable technique to perform software security assessments. Yet, contemporary fuzzers fall short of thoroughly testing applications with a high degree of control-flow diversity, such as firewalls and network packet analyzers. In this paper, we demonstrate how static program analysis can guide fuzzing by augmenting existing program models maintained by the fuzzer. Based on the insight that code patterns reflect the data format of inputs processed by a program, we automatically construct an input dictionary by statically analyzing program control and data flow. Our analysis is performed before fuzzing commences, and the input dictionary is supplied to an off-the-shelf fuzzer to influence input generation. Evaluations show that our technique not only increases test coverage by 10--15{\%} over baseline fuzzers such as afl but also reduces the time required to expose vulnerabilities by up to an order of magnitude. As a case study, we have evaluated our approach on two classes of network applications: nDPI, a deep packet inspection library, and tcpdump, a network packet analyzer. Using our approach, we have uncovered 15 zero-day vulnerabilities in the evaluated software that were not found by stand-alone fuzzers. Our work not only provides a practical method to conduct security evaluations more effectively but also demonstrates that the synergy between program analysis and testing can be exploited for a better outcome.},

At one hand, mutational fuzzers require a set of valid inputs as a starting point, in which modifications are then introduced. On the other hand, generational fuzzing allows to synthesize somehow valid inputs according to a specification. Unfortunately, this requires to have a deep knowledge of the file formats under test to write specifications of them to guide the test case generation process. In this paper we introduce an extended and improved version of QuickFuzz, a tool written in Haskell designed for testing unexpected inputs of common file formats on third-party software, taking advantage of off-the-self well known fuzzers. Unlike other generational fuzzers, QuickFuzz does not require to write specifications for the file formats in question since it relies on existing file-format-handling libraries available on the Haskell code repository. It supports almost 40 different complex file-types including images, documents, source code and digital certificates. In particular, we found QuickFuzz useful enough to discover many previously unknown vulnerabilities on real-world implementations of web browsers and image processing libraries among others.}

  abstract  = {Device drivers are an essential part in modern Unix-like systems to handle operations on physical devices, from hard disks and printers to digital cameras and Bluetooth speakers. The surge of new hardware, particularly on mobile devices, introduces an explosive growth of device drivers in system kernels. Many such drivers are provided by third-party developers, which are susceptible to security vulnerabilities and lack proper vetting. Unfortunately, the complex input data structures for device drivers render traditional analysis tools, such as fuzz testing, less effective, and so far, research on kernel driver security is comparatively sparse. In this paper, we present DIFUZE, an interface-aware fuzzing tool to automatically generate valid inputs and trigger the execution of the kernel drivers. We leverage static analysis to compose correctly-structured input in the userspace to explore kernel drivers. DIFUZE is fully automatic, ranging from identifying driver handlers, to mapping to device file names, to constructing complex argument instances. We evaluate our approach on seven modern Android smartphones. The results show that DIFUZE can effectively identify kernel driver bugs, and reports 32 previously unknown vulnerabilities, including flaws that lead to arbitrary code execution.},

  abstract  = {Coverage-based fuzzing is one of the most effective techniques to find vulnerabilities, bugs or crashes. However, existing techniques suffer from the difficulty in exercising the paths that are protected by magic bytes comparisons (e.g., string equality comparisons). Several approaches have been proposed to use heavy-weight program analysis to break through magic bytes comparisons, and hence are less scalable. In this paper, we propose a program-state based binary fuzzing approach, named Steelix, which improves the penetration power of a fuzzer at the cost of an acceptable slow down of the execution speed. In particular, we use light-weight static analysis and binary instrumentation to provide not only coverage information but also comparison progress information to a fuzzer. Such program state information informs a fuzzer about where the magic bytes are located in the test input and how to perform mutations to match the magic bytes efficiently. We have implemented Steelix and evaluated it on three datasets: LAVA-M dataset, DARPA CGC sample binaries and five real-life programs. The results show that Steelix has better code coverage and bug detection capability than the state-of-the-art fuzzers. Moreover, we found one CVE and nine new bugs.},

  abstract  = {Mutation-based fuzzing is a popular and widely employed black-box testing technique for finding security and robustness bugs in software. It owes much of its success to its simplicity; a well-formed seed input is mutated, e.g. through random bit-flipping, to produce test inputs. While reducing the need for human effort, and enabling security testing even of closed-source programs with undocumented input formats, the simplicity of mutation-based fuzzing comes at the cost of poor code coverage. Often millions of iterations are needed, and the results are highly dependent on configuration parameters and the choice of seed inputs. In this paper we propose a novel method for automated generation of high-coverage test cases for robustness testing. Our method is based on the observation that, even for closed-source programs with proprietary input formats, an implementation that can generate well-formed inputs to the program is typically available. By systematically mutating the program code of such generating programs, we leverage information about the input format encoded in the generating program to produce high-coverage test inputs, capable of reaching deep states in the program under test. Our method works entirely at the machine-code level, enabling use-cases similar to traditional black-box fuzzing. We have implemented the method in our tool MutaGen, and evaluated it on 7 popular Linux programs. We found that, for most programs, our method improves code coverage by one order of magnitude or more, compared to two well-known mutation-based fuzzers. We also found a total of 8 unique bugs.},

  abstract  = {Kernel vulnerabilities are critical in security because they naturally allow attackers to gain unprivileged root access. Although there has been much research on finding kernel vulnerabilities from source code, there are relatively few research on kernel fuzzing, which is a practical bug finding technique that does not require any source code. Existing kernel fuzzing techniques involve feeding in random input values to kernel API functions. However, such a simple approach does not reveal latent bugs deep in the kernel code, because many API functions are dependent on each other, and they can quickly reject arbitrary parameter values based on their calling context. In this paper, we propose a novel fuzzing technique for commodity OS kernels that leverages inferred dependence model between API function calls to discover deep kernel bugs. We implement our technique on a fuzzing system, called IMF. IMF has already found 32 previously unknown kernel vulnerabilities on the latest macOS version 10.12.3 (16D32) at the time of this writing.},

  abstract  = {Fuzzing is a software testing technique that finds bugs by repeatedly injecting mutated inputs to a target program. Known to be a highly practical approach, fuzzing is gaining more popularity than ever before. Current research on fuzzing has focused on producing an input that is more likely to trigger a vulnerability.In this paper, we tackle another way to improve the performance of fuzzing, which is to shorten the execution time of each iteration. We observe that AFL, a state-of-the-art fuzzer, slows down by 24x because of file system contention and the scalability of fork() system call when it runs on 120 cores in parallel. Other fuzzers are expected to suffer from the same scalability bottlenecks in that they follow a similar design pattern. To improve the fuzzing performance, we design and implement three new operating primitives specialized for fuzzing that solve these performance bottlenecks and achieve scalable performance on multi-core machines. Our experiment shows that the proposed primitives speed up AFL and LibFuzzer by 6.1 to 28.9x and 1.1 to 735.7x, respectively, on the overall number of executions per second when targeting Google's fuzzer test suite with 120 cores. In addition, the primitives improve AFL's throughput up to 7.7x with 30 cores, which is a more common setting in data centers. Our fuzzer-agnostic primitives can be easily applied to any fuzzer with fundamental performance improvement and directly benefit large-scale fuzzing and cloud-based fuzzing services.},

  abstract  = {As cloud computing becomes more and more prevalent, there is increased interest in mitigating attacks that target hypervisors from within the virtualized guest environments that they host. We present VDF, a targeted evolutionary fuzzing framework for discovering bugs within the software-based virtual devices implemented as part of a hypervisor. To achieve this, VDF selectively instruments the code of a given virtual device, and performs record and replay of memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) activity specific to the virtual device. We evaluate VDF by performing cloud-based parallel fuzz testing of eighteen virtual devices implemented within the QEMU hypervisor, executing over two billion test cases and revealing over one thousand unique crashes or hangs in one third of the tested devices. Our custom test case minimization algorithm further reduces the erroneous test cases into only 18.57{\%} of the original sizes on average.},

  abstract  = {Algorithmic complexity vulnerabilities occur when the worst-case time/space complexity of an application is significantly higher than the respective average case for particular user-controlled inputs. When such conditions are met, an attacker can launch Denial-of-Service attacks against a vulnerable application by providing inputs that trigger the worst-case behavior. Such attacks have been known to have serious effects on production systems, take down entire websites, or lead to bypasses of Web Application Firewalls.Unfortunately, existing detection mechanisms for algorithmic complexity vulnerabilities are domain-specific and often require significant manual effort. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate SlowFuzz, a domain-independent framework for automatically finding algorithmic complexity vulnerabilities. SlowFuzz automatically finds inputs that trigger worst-case algorithmic behavior in the tested binary. SlowFuzz uses resource-usage-guided evolutionary search techniques to automatically find inputs that maximize computational resource utilization for a given application.We demonstrate that SlowFuzz successfully generates inputs that match the theoretical worst-case performance for several well-known algorithms. SlowFuzz was also able to generate a large number of inputs that trigger different algorithmic complexity vulnerabilities in real-world applications, including various zip parsers used in antivirus software, regular expression libraries used in Web Application Firewalls, as well as hash table implementations used in Web applications. In particular, SlowFuzz generated inputs that achieve 300-times slowdown in the decompression routine of the bzip utility, discovered regular expressions that exhibit matching times exponential in the input size, and also managed to automatically produce inputs that trigger a high number of collisions in PHP's default hashtable implementation.},

  abstract  = {Coverage-based Greybox Fuzzing (CGF) is a random testing approach that requires no program analysis. A new test is generated by slightly mutating a seed input. If the test exercises a new and interesting path, it is added to the set of seeds; otherwise, it is discarded. We observe that most tests exercise the same few "high-frequency" paths and develop strategies to explore significantly more paths with the same number of tests by gravitating towards low-frequency paths. We explain the challenges and opportunities of CGF using a Markov chain model which specifies the probability that fuzzing the seed that exercises path i generates an input that exercises path j. Each state (i.e., seed) has an energy that specifies the number of inputs to be generated from that seed. We show that CGF is considerably more efficient if energy is inversely proportional to the density of the stationary distribution and increases monotonically every time that seed is chosen. Energy is controlled with a power schedule.We implemented the exponential schedule by extending AFL. In 24 hours, AFLFAST exposes 3 previously unreported CVEs that are not exposed by AFL and exposes 6 previously unreported CVEs 7x faster than AFL. AFLFAST produces at least an order of magnitude more unique crashes than AFL.},

Other than showing fuzzers find bugs, there has been little systematic effort in understanding the science of how to fuzz properly. In this paper, we focus on how to mathematically formulate and reason about one critical aspect in fuzzing: how best to pick seed files to maximize the total number of bugs found during a fuzz campaign. We design and evaluate six different algorithms using over 650 CPU days on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) to provide ground truth data. Overall, we find 240 bugs in 8 applications and show that the choice of algorithm can greatly increase the number of bugs found. We also show that current seed selection strategies as found in Peach may fare no better than picking seeds at random. We make our data set and code publicly available.},

We develop an analytic framework using a mathematical model of black-box mutational fuzzing and use it to evaluate 26 existing and new randomized online scheduling algorithms. Our experiments show that one of our new scheduling algorithms outperforms the multi-armed bandit algorithm in the current version of the CERT Basic Fuzzing Framework (BFF) by finding 1.5x more unique bugs in the same amount of time.},
